# Introduction

### Step1: Requirements clarifications

### Step 2: Back-of-the-envelope estimation

- What scale is expected from the system (e.g., number of new tweets, number of tweet views, number of timeline generations per sec., etc.)?
- How much storage will we need? We will have different storage requirements if users can have photos and videos in their tweets.
- What network bandwidth usage are we expecting? This will be crucial in deciding how we will manage traffic and balance load between servers.

### Step 3: System interface definition

* Define what APIs are expected from the system.

### Step 4: Defining data model

### Step 5: High-level design

* Draw a block diagram with 5-6 boxes representing the core components of our system

### Step 6: Detailed design

* Since we will be storing a massive amount of data, how should we partition our data to distribute it to multiple databases? Should we try to store all the data of a user on the same database? What issue could it cause?
* How will we handle hot users who tweet a lot or follow lots of people?
* Since usersâ€™ timeline will contain the most recent (and relevant) tweets, should we try to store our data so that it is optimized for scanning the latest tweets?
* How much and at which layer should we introduce cache to speed things up?
* What components need better load balancing?

### Step 7: Identifying and resolving bottlenecks

- Is there any single point of failure in our system? What are we doing to mitigate it?
- Do we have enough replicas of the data so that we can still serve our users if we lose a few servers?
- Similarly, do we have enough copies of different services running such that a few failures will not cause a total system shutdown?
- How are we monitoring the performance of our service? Do we get alerts whenever critical components fail or their performance degrades?
